Here is the bootstrap of the SF using Openstack HEAT
----------------------------------------------------

Once the SF edeploy roles has been built you can use the start.sh
script to call heat stack-create to deploy a SF stack.

The script will take care to update roles into glance before
starting the heat stack.

Be sure to have correctly set the variable on top of the start.sh
script and to have sourced the correct ENV variables to access
your tenant/user (openrc).
